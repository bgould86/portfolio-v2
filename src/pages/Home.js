          <p>I am a coding bootcamp student based in Phoenix, Arizona, who expects to hit the job market in early June 2022. By late May 2022, I expect to have a strong familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Express, React, mySQL, Java, and hopefully much more. On a personal note, I enjoy darts, LEGO, getting mad at the news, and my dog, Sandwich.</p>
